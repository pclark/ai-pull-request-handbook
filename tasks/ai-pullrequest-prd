# AI-Enhanced Pull Request Guide: Markdown GitHub Project PRD

## TL;DR

Transform the AI Pull Request Guide into a high-fidelity, GitHub markdown-based handbook to serve as a reliable reference for engineers and teams within their existing workflow. The project ensures pristine example formatting and accessibility, empowering contributors to maximize GitHub's native documentation features for daily use and onboarding. The primary target audience is software engineers, reviewers, and technical leads seeking clear, version-controlled guidance directly within GitHub.

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Increase adoption of best pull request practices by 50% within three months
- Enhance accessibility to internal documentation, reducing support requests related to PR workflows by 30%
- Position the company as a modern engineering organization by standardizing key guides on GitHub
- Reduce onboarding time for new engineers by providing a single source of truth for PR processes
- Support future documentation automation and integrations within the GitHub platform

### User Goals

- Provide engineers and reviewers with easy-to-find, crystal-clear pull request guidance directly in repo context
- Ensure accurate reproduction of workflow examples, with copy-paste reliability
- Empower users to contribute and improve handbook content via standard GitHub PR processes
- Enable seamless readability on desktop and mobile devices
- Foster a culture of shared understanding on pull request processes

### Non-Goals

- No creation of new pull request process content outside the current AI Pull Request Guide scope
- No introduction of novel workflows or automation—focus is on static, high fidelity markdown delivery
- No support for external documentation platforms or file exports in this release

## User Stories

### Persona: Software Engineer

- As an engineer, I want to quickly find PR checklist examples in the repo, so that I can follow best practices without switching tools
- As an engineer, I want to copy markdown code and checklists from the guide, so that I can use them directly in my PRs

### Persona: Code Reviewer

- As a reviewer, I want to reference official PR standards while reviewing, so that I can ensure quality and consistency
- As a reviewer, I want to share links to specific guideline sections in code reviews, so that feedback is precise and actionable

### Persona: Engineering Manager

- As a manager, I want the onboarding process to point new team members to a single source of PR truth, so that ramp-up is efficient and uniform
- As a manager, I want to see evidence that engineers are consulting the handbook, so that I know it is trusted and current

### Persona: Documentation Contributor

- As a contributor, I want to submit edits and improvements via PRs, so that content stays accurate and evolves with feedback
- As a contributor, I want to check each markdown change in rich preview, so formatting never breaks

## Functional Requirements

### Markdown Fidelity (Priority: Highest)

- **Formatting Accuracy**: All examples, lists, checklists, tables, and templates must render identically in GitHub markdown preview
- **Copy-Paste Reliability**: Markdown content (e.g., checklists, code snippets) should be immediately usable in GitHub PRs
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks and examples must use proper language tags for maximum clarity
- **Section Linking**: Each heading should allow direct linking for easy referencing in reviews and team discussions

### Content Structure (Priority: High)

- **Clear Navigation**: Table of Contents at the top, with anchor links to all major sections
- **Modular Files**: Organize handbook into logical markdown files (e.g., introduction.md, checklists.md, templates.md)
- **Consistent Style**: Use standardized heading levels, blockquotes, and emphasis for uniform reading experience

### Contributor Experience (Priority: Medium)

- **Contribution Guide**: Add a CONTRIBUTING.md explaining how to propose changes
- **Preview Instructions**: Step-by-step for using GitHub's preview and PR flow for markdown edits

### Accessibility & Portability (Priority: Medium)

- **Responsive Markdown**: Ensure readability on both desktop and mobile GitHub experiences
- **Minimal Images**: Favor markdown-native diagrams and tables over images for accessibility and consistency

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

- Users typically discover the handbook via the repo README.md or an onboarding email linking to the main guide
- Contributors are guided to a welcome section outlining how to navigate, with a prominent Table of Contents at the top
- Simple onboarding instructions clarify how to copy examples, submit edits, and preview formatting within GitHub

### Core Experience

1. **Step 1**: User lands on the handbook's primary markdown file (README.md or index.md)
   - Clear visual hierarchy with heading structure and a navigation table or sidebar
   - Immediate access to core PR guidelines and checklists, minimal scrolling required on desktop and mobile

2. **Step 2**: User clicks into relevant section (e.g., "How to Write a Great PR Description"), navigates via anchor or sidebar
   - Sections use collapsible details (where supported) and inline callouts for fast scanning

3. **Step 3**: User copies code snippets or checklists using native markdown formatting
   - Markdown samples appear exactly as they will in actual PRs; previewing in GitHub is seamless

4. **Step 4**: If edits are needed, user follows clear "Edit this page" call to action
   - Contributor submits a pull request; receives feedback on formatting in preview checks

5. **Step 5**: Team regularly references the handbook in PR comments, sharing anchored links for context

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Power users propose improvements or add internal examples via PR
- Edge case: Copying markdown with platform-specific formatting quirks (e.g., line endings) is addressed with clear instructions and supported formatting
- Guide is resilient to GitHub dark/light mode and font size changes

### UI/UX Highlights

- Robust color contrast in markdown callouts and tables
- Consistent use of headings and bullet lists for accessibility
- Fully responsive content: single-column flow on mobile, multi-level navigation on desktop
- Emphasis on keyboard navigation for accessibility (e.g., Tab-index for section links)

## Narrative

Imagine a team of engineers at a fast-growing tech company. Each sprint, they juggle dozens of code changes and reviews—some from veterans, others from new hires. Team leads noticed inconsistencies in PR quality and confusion around best practices, especially for remote engineers joining the organization. Documentation existed, but it was buried in internal wikis and scattered across different platforms—out of sight, out of mind.

With the AI-Enhanced Pull Request Guide in GitHub markdown format, that all changed. Now, every contributor has one-click access to a living handbook where actionable checklists, standards, and templates are always in sync with daily workflows. Engineers and reviewers reference it in real-time during code reviews, copying markdown templates directly into their PRs with perfect formatting. New contributors navigate onboarding confidently, while experienced engineers link directly to exactly the right section to clarify feedback.

The result? Not only do PRs improve in clarity and completeness, but onboarding becomes frictionless, and distributed teams rally around the same, visible source of truth. For managers and leads, the investment accelerates team velocity, increases code quality, and demonstrates a commitment to operational excellence. The guide is actively maintained, easy to enhance, and becomes an indispensable part of the engineering culture.

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- **Handbook Access Rate**: % of repository users visiting the markdown guide each week (Target: 75%+ within 30 days)
- **Example Usage**: # of times markdown checklists or templates are copied (measured via PR template usage or user surveys)
- **Onboarding Satisfaction**: Survey responses from new hires around clarity of PR expectations (Target: 90%+ rating "clear or very clear")

### Business Metrics
