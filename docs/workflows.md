    A[Developer Opens PR with Template] --> B[AI Gate Check]
    B --> C[Fix Gaps & Add Evidence]
    C --> D[CI/CD Validation]
    D --> E[Human Review]
    E --> F[Merge to Production]
    
    B --> G[AI Identifies Missing Requirements]
    G --> C
    
    D --> H[Automated Rule Enforcement]
    H --> I[Core Rules Validated]
    I --> E
    
    E --> J[Design & Risk Assessment]
    J --> K[Business Logic Review]
    K --> F
```

### Detailed Workflow Steps

#### 1. Developer Opens PR with Template
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Feature Complete] --> B[Open PR]
    B --> C[Template Auto-Fills]
    C --> D[Fill Core Sections]
    D --> E[Add Evidence Links]
```

**What happens:**
- Developer completes feature development
- Opens pull request in GitHub
- PR template automatically populates
- Developer fills in required sections with evidence links

#### 2. AI Gate Check
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PR Opened] --> B[AI Analyzes Content]
    B --> C[Load Relevant Rules]
    C --> D[Identify Gaps]
    D --> E[Generate Feedback]
```

**What happens:**
- AI assistant (Claude/Copilot) analyzes PR content
- Loads relevant rule files (Core + Conditional)
- Identifies missing requirements and evidence
- Generates specific, actionable feedback

#### 3. Fix Gaps & Add Evidence
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Feedback] --> B[Developer Reviews]
    B --> C[Add Missing Tests]
    C --> D[Add Security Scans]
    D --> E[Add Observability]
    E --> F[Update PR Description]
```

**What happens:**
- Developer reviews AI feedback
- Adds missing tests, security scans, documentation
- Updates PR description with evidence links
- Marks Conditional rules as N/A where appropriate

#### 4. CI/CD Validation
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PR Updated] --> B[GitHub Actions Trigger]
    B --> C[Validate Core Rules]
    C --> D[Check Evidence Links]
    D --> E[Run Security Scans]
    E --> F[Validate Templates]
    F --> G[Post Results]
```

**What happens:**
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers on PR update
- Validates all Core rules are satisfied
- Checks evidence links are accessible
- Runs automated security scans
- Posts validation results as PR comment

#### 5. Human Review
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[CI Passes] --> B[Human Reviewer Assigned]
    B --> C[Review Design Quality]
    C --> D[Assess Business Logic]
    D --> E[Evaluate Risk]
    E --> F[Approve/Request Changes]
```

**What happens:**
- Human reviewer focuses on design and architecture
- Evaluates business logic and product alignment
- Assesses production risk and tradeoffs
- Reviews code maintainability and clarity

#### 6. Merge to Production
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Review Approved] --> B[All Gates Satisfied]
    B --> C[Merge to Main]
    C --> D[Deploy to Production]
    D --> E[Monitor & Validate]
```

**What happens:**
- All validation gates are satisfied
- PR merges to main branch
- Automated deployment to production
- Monitoring and validation of changes

## Workflow Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: AI Check Fails
**Problem**: AI assistant reports missing requirements
**Solution**:
1. Review AI feedback carefully
2. Add missing evidence links
3. Mark Conditional rules as N/A if appropriate
4. Re-run AI check after updates

#### Issue: CI/CD Validation Fails
**Problem**: GitHub Actions reports rule violations
**Solution**:
1. Check CI logs for specific failures
2. Ensure all Core rules are satisfied
3. Verify evidence links are accessible
4. Fix formatting issues in PR description

#### Issue: Human Review Takes Too Long
**Problem**: Reviewers spend too much time on checklist items
**Solution**:
1. Ensure AI and CI have validated all mechanical requirements
2. Focus human review on design and business logic
3. Provide clear evidence links for quality measures
4. Train reviewers on new workflow

#### Issue: Merge Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple PRs cause merge conflicts
**Solution**:
1. Keep PRs small and focused
2. Coordinate with team on overlapping changes
3. Use feature flags to avoid conflicts
4. Implement proper branching strategy
