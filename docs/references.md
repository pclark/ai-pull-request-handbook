## Link Validation Guidelines

### GitHub Actions Links
- **Format**: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}`
- **Validation**: Link should be accessible and show successful test execution
- **Example**: `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/actions/runs/12345678`

### Coverage Report Links
- **Codecov**: `https://codecov.io/gh/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{commit_sha}`
- **Coveralls**: `https://coveralls.io/github/{owner}/{repo}`
- **SonarQube**: `https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id={project_key}`

### Security Scan Links
- **GitHub Security**: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/security/code-scanning`
- **Snyk**: `https://app.snyk.io/org/{org}/project/{project}`
- **Veracode**: `https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/{app_id}`

### Performance Testing Links
- **GitHub Actions**: Link to performance test job
- **Jenkins**: Link to performance test build
- **Custom CI**: Link to performance test results

### Observability Links
- **Grafana**: `https://grafana.example.com/d/{dashboard_uid}`
- **Prometheus**: `https://prometheus.example.com/graph`
- **Datadog**: `https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/{dashboard_id}`

## Evidence Link Best Practices

### Link Accessibility
- ‚úÖ **Public Access**: Links should be accessible to all reviewers
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Links**: Use permanent links that won't expire
- ‚úÖ **Specific Context**: Link to specific results, not general pages
- ‚ùå **Private Links**: Avoid links requiring special authentication
- ‚ùå **Temporary Links**: Don't use links that expire quickly

### Link Context
- ‚úÖ **Descriptive Text**: Provide context for what the link shows
- ‚úÖ **Status Information**: Include pass/fail status in description
- ‚úÖ **Relevant Metrics**: Include key metrics or scores
- ‚ùå **Generic Links**: Avoid links without context
- ‚ùå **Broken Links**: Ensure all links are working and accessible

### Link Formatting
```markdown
‚úÖ **Unit tests**: [GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/12345678) - All 47 tests passed
‚úÖ **Coverage**: [Codecov report](https://codecov.io/gh/org/repo/commit/abc123) - 87% coverage (target: 80%)
‚úÖ **Security scan**: [SAST results](https://github.com/org/repo/security/code-scanning) - 0 high/critical issues
```

## Validation Checklist

## Common Link Patterns

### GitHub Actions
```markdown
[GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id})
[Workflow file](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/main/.github/workflows/{workflow}.yml)
```

### Security Scans
```markdown
[SAST scan](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/security/code-scanning)
[Dependabot alerts](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/security/dependabot)
[Secret scanning](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/security/secret-scanning)
```

### Testing & Coverage
```markdown
[Unit tests](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id})
[Integration tests](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id})
[Coverage report](https://codecov.io/gh/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{commit_sha})
```

### Observability
```markdown
[Dashboard](https://grafana.example.com/d/{dashboard_uid})
[Metrics](https://prometheus.example.com/graph?g0.expr={query})
[Alerts](https://grafana.example.com/alerting/list)
```

### Documentation
```markdown
[API docs](https://docs.example.com/api/v1.0)
[User guide](https://docs.example.com/user-guide)
[Migration guide](https://docs.example.com/migration/v2.0)
```

## Link Validation Tools

### Automated Link Checking
- **GitHub Actions**: Use link checking workflows
- **Markdown Linters**: Include link validation in CI/CD
- **Custom Scripts**: Build custom link validation tools

### Manual Link Validation
- **Accessibility**: Test all links for accessibility
- **Context**: Verify links provide relevant evidence
- **Permanence**: Ensure links won't expire or break
- **Security**: Verify links don't expose sensitive information

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Broken Links
- **Issue**: Links return 404 or access denied
- **Solution**: Update links to working URLs, check permissions
- **Prevention**: Use permanent links, test accessibility

### Missing Context
- **Issue**: Links don't clearly show what they validate
- **Solution**: Add descriptive text explaining the evidence
- **Prevention**: Include context in link descriptions

### Expired Links
- **Issue**: Links work initially but expire later
- **Solution**: Use permanent links, archive important results
- **Prevention**: Choose link sources that maintain permanent URLs

### Access Issues
- **Issue**: Links require special authentication
- **Solution**: Use public links or provide access instructions
- **Prevention**: Ensure all evidence is publicly accessible
